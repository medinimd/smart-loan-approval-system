# Smart Loan Approval System

The Smart Loan Approval System is a machine learning–based model that analyzes historical loan data to predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected. It uses applicant financial and demographic features to assess credit risk and generate accurate, data-driven approval decisions.


## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Loan Approval System** is a machine learning–based project designed to automate and improve the loan approval decision process. The system analyzes applicant data and predicts whether a loan should be approved or rejected using supervised learning algorithms.

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, feature engineering, and comparison using multiple machine learning models implemented in **Python** within a **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** environment.
